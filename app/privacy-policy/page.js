          This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared
          when you visit our website (<b>“Site”</b>

        <SubheaderText>PERSONAL INFORMATION WE COLLECT</SubheaderText>
        <p>
          When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device,
          including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the
          cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we
          collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, and
          information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected
          information as <b>“Device Information”</b>.
        </p>
        <p> We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</p>
        <ListWrapper role="list">
          <li>
            “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an

          </li>
          <li>
            “Log files” track actions occurring on the Site, and collect data including your IP
            address, browser type, Internet service provider, referring/exit pages, and date/time
            stamps.
          </li>

        </ListWrapper>
        <p>
          Additionally we do not facilitate real purchases or collect payment information. Any
          references to purchases or payment information on the website are for demonstration
          purposes only. No actual transactions or payment processing occur on this website. We
          refer to this information as <b>“Order Information”</b>.

        <SubheaderText>HOW DO WE USE YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION?</SubheaderText>
        <p>
          We use the Order Information that we collect generally for demonstration purposes only.
          While you may interact with features that simulate order placement, including providing
          information such as name, address, and payment details, please note that no actual orders
          are processed, and no payment information is collected or stored by our website. The Order
          Information provided by you is used solely for demonstration purposes, such as showcasing
          website functionality or conducting tests, and is not retained or used for any other
          purpose.
        </p>
        <p>
          We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and
          malicious activity (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and
          optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our users browse and
          interact with the Site).
